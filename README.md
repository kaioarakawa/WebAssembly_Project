# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.



## Critique

This frontend comes with the webassembly idea, we bring the average example but we can choise each other function to bring for this project and make more fast

### Structure

The front are made with the best possible structure for the moment, however I see the division into more components for better reuse, improve the css and utils.

### Design System

As the idea is something scalable for the front, a good idea is to create an entire design system of its own with original and unique palettes to leave the system with a Posterr look and also for any extension to follow the same basis. One idea would be to implement StoryBook completely and effectively.

### UX & UI 
 
Improve more the flow for this app and make some refresh and better loading 

### Functions in webassembly
 
Create new functions for bring more conversions to frontend and improve the functions to do all the actions inside the trigger
